        <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Types of cemeteries</h1>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">Different types of cemeteries and memorial parks offer different options, and each cemetery has unique
            features to consider. Personally touring a cemetery and understanding what's available can help you choose
            the best fit for yourself, your loved one or your family.</p>

        <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Public cemeteries</h1>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">Though it may be privately owned or managed by a religious organization, municipality or government entity, a
            cemetery is considered public if it's <b>available to a broad section of the community</b>. Public
            cemeteries serve neighborhoods, churches or entire towns, offering families the opportunity to create <a
                href=""><u>lasting memorials</u></a> for individual loved ones or their whole clan. All Dignity Memorial
            cemeteries are public, ensuring that any family can find a meaningful space to <a href=""><u>honor and
                    remember</u></a> those they've lost.</p>


        <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Private cemeteries</h1>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">A cemetery is considered private when it serves <b>only a family or a select group</b>, with property not
            available for public purchase. Often located on private property, private burial grounds are typically
            managed by a family, offering a very personal and intimate final resting place for loved ones. Private
            cemeteries reflect a family's desire for exclusivity and privacy, creating a space that is uniquely their
            own for honoring their heritage and legacy.</p>


        <img src="./images/private_cemeteries.jpg" alt="Private Cemeteries">


        <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Veterans cemeteries</h1>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">If you or a loved one is a veteran, you may be interested in being laid to rest in a veterans cemetery.
            <b>Exclusively for eligible members of the armed forces and their families</b>, veterans cemeteries are run
            either on the state or tribal level by local governments or on the national level by federal government
            organizations like the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration or the
            Department of the Army. Burial services often involve <a href=""><u>military funeral honors</u></a>, and
            government funding may be available to you or a loved one, depending on your situation.</p>


        <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Religious cemeteries</h1>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4"><b>Reserved for members of a specific religious community</b>, a religious cemetery is often owned, operated
            or managed by a church, religious society or denomination. This type of cemetery is usually dedicated as
            sacred or blessed (consecrated). It may have specific guidelines around how a loved one may be laid to rest.
            A religious cemetery may be a good fit if you want a final resting place specific to your faith or if your
            loved one was active in their church or temple and wants to be memorialized in a cemetery that reflects
            their devotion.</p>



        <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Green cemeteries</h1>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">Green cemeteries represent a shift toward more sustainable end-of-life practices, offering <a
                href=""><u>alternatives to traditional burial methods</u></a> and <b>focusing on minimizing
                environmental impact and preserving natural beauty</b>. This type of cemetery usually centers around
            natural burials that forego the use of embalming chemicals, metal caskets or concrete vaults and instead use
            biodegradable urns and caskets, containers or shrouds. They may be part of a conservation effort in which
            natural habitats are cultivated and ground maintenance is minimal. Families who choose green cemeteries do
            so for their simplicity and connection to nature. A green cemetery may be a standalone burial ground solely
            dedicated to green burial practices or a special section of a traditional cemetery.</p>

        <img src="./images/green_cemeteries.jpg" alt="Green Cemeteries">




        <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Underwater cemeteries</h1>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">After cremation, many families create permanent memorials where they can visit and reflect on the lives of
            their loved ones. <a href=""><u>Neptune Memorial ReefÂ®</u></a> is an underwater cemetery off the east coast
            of Florida, beneath the surface of the Atlantic. Families who choose <b>underwater memorialization</b> have
            a couple of options. A professional team scatters a loved one's ashes in open water at the site of the reef,
            and a certified diver places a copper cenotaph on the reef. Or a loved one's ashes are blended with a sturdy
            substance that is artistically sculpted or molded and placed in the artificial barrier reef that is home to
            tens of thousands of animals. Families can take their own boats to visit the reef or join up with one of the
            professional scuba operations that go to the reef weekly.</p>



        <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Traditional cemeteries</h1>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">Whether public, private, veterans or religious, most cemeteries are traditional cemeteries. There, loved ones
            are laid to rest in the ground and above it. Traditional cemeteries include burial gardens and mausoleums.
            They may also include cremation options, veterans gardens, religious sections, gardens for children, pet
            cemeteries and more. They are serene spaces for people to visit and remember and honor their loved ones.</p>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">Not all cemeteries offer all options. If you're interested in a particular option, be sure to ask your
            Dignity Memorial provider.</p>


        <h3 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Is there a difference between a cemetery and a memorial garden or memorial park?</h3>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">There is a difference between a cemetery and a memorial garden or memorial park, though the terms are often
            used interchangeably.</p>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">Cemetery is a general term for any place where loved ones are buried. Cemeteries tend to have upright
            headstones and grave markers. They tend to have a traditional, established look and feel.</p>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">Memorial gardens or memorial parks tend to have more modern features. They often emphasize the natural
            environment. Memorial parks usually have flat markers instead of upright headstones to maintain a more
            streamlined, open landscape. This allows for more green space, trees, flowers and pathways, giving it the
            feel of a garden or park.</p>



        <img src="./images/difference_between_cemeteries.jpg" alt="">



        <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">In-ground options for traditional burial and cremation</h1>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">In-ground burial offers families a meaningful, permanent way to honor their loved ones. This option includes
            plots marked by headstones and grave markers commemorating those who are interred there, either in a casket
            or an urn.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-16 md:text-2xl sm:text-sm">Individual plots</h3>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">In-ground casket burial or urn burial plot is a traditional choice. Plots for caskets are much larger than
            plots for urns. Depending on the cemetery, a plot can be single depth (deep enough for one casket or urn) or
            double depth (deep enough for two). Double-depth plots are good options for couples or family members who
            wish to be buried together.</p>


        <h3 class="mt-16 md:text-2xl sm:text-sm">Private estates</h3>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">Private estates include gated estates and hedge estates for in-ground casket or urn burial. A gated estate is
            like a private cemetery within a cemetery. Typically, more than one person can be buried there, and the
            property is sectioned off with a wall or fence. Similarly, hedgerows indicate the perimeter of a hedge
            estate. A private estate is a good choice for a family who wants to be buried together. Casketed burials and
            cremation options are frequently mixed in private estates.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-16 md:text-2xl sm:text-sm">Lawn crypts</h3>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">An affordable option for both casket and urn burial, lawn crypts are underground burial spaces that combine
            the benefits of ground burial with some of the advantages of a mausoleum. Lawn crypts have preinstalled
            outer burial containers that not only save on costs but also ensure that the ground above the grave remains
            level over time, maintaining the cemetery's aesthetics. Many lawn crypts are designed for two burials,
            allowing couples or family members to be buried together in the same space.</p>


        <h3 class="mt-16 md:text-2xl sm:text-sm">Urn gardens</h3>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">Urn gardens are areas in cemeteries designed for urn burial. They are usually landscaped with flowers and
            trees, and they may feature aboveground cremation options, such as benches, boulders, pedestals and
            columbaria.</p>

        <img src="./images/urn_gardens.jpg" alt="Urn Gardens">





        <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Aboveground options for traditional burial and cremation</h1>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">Most of us are familiar with burial, but what is aboveground entombment? This option involves placing a loved
            one in a sealed crypt or niche within a mausoleum or columbarium. You or a loved one might select
            aboveground entombment based on personal preferences, cultural and religious beliefs and geographical
            limitations. There are various choices, including private spaces or community options, all of which can be
            personalized to honor a loved one.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-16 md:text-2xl sm:text-sm">Community mausoleums</h3>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">Community mausoleums are typically built with granite, and they are sometimes very large and stately
            structures. A garden mausoleum has only outdoor crypts. An indoor mausoleum is a climate-controlled building
            that's comfortable for visitors even in very hot or very cold weather. Depending on the mausoleum, choices
            can include single spaces, side-by-side spaces and companion configurations.</p>


        <h3 class="mt-16 md:text-2xl sm:text-sm">Private mausoleums</h3>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">Private mausoleums are exclusive, custom-built, aboveground spaces usually for a prominent individual, couple
            or family. The person or family building the mausoleum works with a designer to customize the architecture
            of the structure as well as features such as bronze doors or stained-glass windows. These exclusive
            mausoleums can be built to hold caskets, urns or both.</p>


        <h3 class="mt-16 md:text-2xl sm:text-sm">Columbaria</h3>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">A <a href=""><u>columbarium</u></a> is a room or structure designed to house ashes. Columbaria are permanent
            memorials with banks of cremation niches (similar to cubbyholes but with secure fronts). A columbarium can
            be large or small, private or public. Some columbaria have glass-front niches, which allow visitors to see a
            loved one's urn and personal artifacts stored with it. Other columbaria have granite-front niches that can
            be engraved or memorialized with a plaque. Some columbaria have both.</p>


        <h3 class="mt-16 md:text-2xl sm:text-sm">Benches, boulders and pedestals</h3>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">Personalized tributes such as cremation pedestals, benches and boulders provide lasting memorials for future
            generations to visit, reflect and remember. Typically made of <a href=""><u>granite, bronze or
                    marble</u></a>, pedestals and benches can be inscribed with names, dates, messages, mottoes, verses
            and more. Similarly, pedestals may mark where ashes are buried or they may hold urns inside. Cremation
            boulders offer the same personalization while blending in with the natural environment.</p>

        <img src="./images/benches_boulders_and_pedestals.jpg" alt="benches, boulders and pedestals">



        <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Cost of cemetery property</h1>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">The <a href=""><u>cost of cemetery property</u></a> varies depending on the location of the cemetery, the
            type of property, the location within the cemetery and the level of customization. Custom-built memorials,
            such as personalized tributes in granite, bronze or marble, may cost tens or hundreds of thousands. A place
            in a community mausoleum or a burial plot simply marked are more affordable options.</p>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">If you wish to learn more about cemetery property options and what may fit your budget and needs, a Dignity
            Memorial professional can answer your questions and show you available properties.</p>


        <h1 class="mt-16 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Purchasing cemetery property ahead of time</h1>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4">A plan for end-of-life arrangements goes beyond choosing and paying for cemetery property. <a
                href=""><u>Pre-planning</u></a> ensures your wishes are honored and removes pressure on your loved ones
            to make decisions on your behalf. It also allows you to prepay for a funeral, cremation or celebration of
            life.</p>
        <p class="mx-2 my-4"><a href=""><u>Prepayment</u></a> guards against rising costs by locking in today's prices on many items, and
            it relieves your family of a financial burden at the time of a loss. A Dignity Memorial funeral provider can
            guide you through the process of creating and documenting a detailed plan, giving you and your family peace
            of mind.
