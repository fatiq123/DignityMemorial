        <p class="pt-4">Yes, you can prepay for a cremation. By selecting a funeral or cremation provider in advance, not only can
            you make your wishes known, <b>you can also prepay for the cremation services in installments</b>. Funeral
            homes, cremation providers and cemeteries don't typically offer payment plans at the time of need, but you
            are able to <a href=""><u>fund arrangements ahead of time with a payment plan</u></a>.</p>


        <h1 class="pt-8 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Can you prepay for a cremation memorial or funeral service?</h1>
        <p class="py-4">Yes. Not only can you prepay for the cremation itself, <b>most funeral homes also allow you to pay for the
                memorial, funeral or celebration of life in advance</b>. This comes with the additional benefits of
            funding your arrangements with a payment plan, plus it takes the burden of making arrangements off loved
            ones during their time of grief. At funeral homes in the Dignity MemorialÂ® family, you get the added benefit

        <h1 class="md:text-4xl sm:text-xl py-8">What are the options for prepaid cremation services?</h1>
        <p class=""><b>From simple cremation to celebration of life or traditional funeral services, there is virtually no limit
                to the types of services offered for prepaid cremations</b>. Funeral homes typically offer packages
            designed specifically for families choosing cremation to streamline the process. As always, they also offer
            a la carte options so that individuals can design their services exactly the way they want them.</p>

        <p>Packages might include:</p>

        <ul class="list-disc px-8 py-4">
            <li>A simple cremation without a service. Sometimes called direct cremation, this choice includes just the
                basics, such as transportation of the deceased, a cremation casket and cremation paperwork.
                <br>
                We see this option chosen most often for individuals with just a few living friends or family, or in
                situations when keeping costs down is most important.
            </li>

            <li class="py-4"><b>A cremation with a memorial service or celebration of life</b>. In addition to transportation of the
                loved one and the cremation itself, this package usually includes a beautiful container for the ashes
                and a service at the funeral home or a place of worship. These services can happen before, immediately
                following or long after the cremation has taken place.
                <br>
                This option is an increasingly popular choice. We see it chosen most among families without a strong
                desire to follow specific rituals, instead favoring remembrance of the good times and celebration of the
                life lived. Families don't feel as rushed to schedule services immediately, giving more time to plan
                travel. <a href=""><u>Learn more about celebrations of life</u></a>.
            </li>


            <li><b>A cremation with a funeral service</b>. In addition to transportation of the loved one and the
                cremation itself, this usually includes embalming, hair and makeup services, a casket, a viewing at the
                funeral home, and a funeral service before the cremation takes place.
            </li>

        </ul>


        <p >We see this option chosen most often for individuals with a preference to follow traditional religious
            rituals. Viewing or presence of the full body at the visitation or funeral sets this option apart.</p>





        <h1 class="pt-16 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">
            Can you prepay for burial or placement of cremated ashes?
        </h1>

        <p class="py-8"><b>Yes, many people choose to prepay to have their ashes buried in a cemetery or placed in an outdoor or indoor niche</b>. Along with traditional urns, cremation containers and scattering tubes, more contemporary memorial options, such as cremation jewelry, glass and other keepsakes, ocean memorials or cremation spaceflights can also be prepaid. Do-it-yourself options like ash scattering typically cannot be prepaid.</p>

        <p class="py-8">Paying for cremation in advance has many important benefits, including:</p>


        <ol class="list-decimal px-8">
            <li><b>Makes a difficult time easier for survivors</b>. Many people choose prepaid cremation because they want to reduce the burden on their family. By taking care of the details ahead of time, you minimize the number of potentially overwhelming decisions your loved ones face after your death.</li>
            <li class="py-2"><b>Eases a financial burden</b>. Funding a funeral shortly after a death can be a financial hardship for many families. A prepaid cremation plan allows you to cover costs ahead of time, so your family doesn't have to think about money. Plus, you get the option to pay in <a href=""><u>affordable monthly installments</u></a>.</li>
            <li><b>Ensures your wishes are honored</b>. By making arrangements in advance, you can be confident that you'll get the service you envision.</li>
            <li class="py-2"><b>Protects against rising costs</b>. Most prepaid cremation plans include guaranteed pricing, which means that today's costs are locked in, protecting your loved ones from potentially higher costs in the future.</li>
            <li><b>Gives you peace of mind</b>. Similar to insurance for the unexpected, a prepaid cremation can provide a sense of comfort. When you prepare in advance, you rest easier at night.</li>

        <p class="py-8">Here's how to prepay for a cremation:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc px-8">
            <li>Start by <a href=""><u>contacting</u></a> one or more funeral homes or cremation providers.</li>
            <li class="py-2">Set an appointment with a pre-planning advisor, who will meet you at your home, at their location, or online or by phone. The advisor will explain their services, benefits and associated costs in about an hour. If you wish, you can make selections and make payment during the meeting, but it's not expected.</li>
            <li>When you have decided which provider to use, you can then discuss payment optionsâusually a lump sum or installment paymentsâand whether to use insurance or a trust. In any case, the funds are protected from business disruption or bankruptcy.</li>

        <h1 class="md:text-4xl sm:text-xl py-8">What is a cremation society? How does it work?</h1>
        <p class="py-2">Years ago, a cremation society was an organization that helped facilitate prepaid cremations. Members paid a fee to join and got help planning their cremations and reduced rates on prepaid cremation services. The model changed to a more standard direct-to-consumer business model, but the name stuck.</p>
        <p class="py-2">Today, <b>the word "society" is part of the names of some cremation providers that do simple cremations without services like viewings or memorials</b>. Their locations are usually small retail shops in larger cities, as opposed to full-service funeral homes that can offer spaces for gatherings. They usually do not offer permanent placement of ashes in a cemetery, nor do they coordinate celebrations of life or receptions. Neptune Society and National Cremation Society are the two largest cremation societies in the United States.</p>

        <h1 class="md:text-4xl sm:text-xl py-8">What paperwork is required for a prepaid cremation?</h1>
        <p>The only constant in life is change. When you choose a prepaid cremation plan at a Dignity Memorial provider and then move, the plan remains in effect. If you move more than 75 miles from the location where your original arrangements were made, your prearranged servicesâand your cremation trustâare transferable and will be honored at any of more than 1,900 providers in the United States and Canada.
