        <h1 class="pt-8 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Do you need a casket for cremation?</h1>
        <p class="pt-4"><a href=""><u>The casket</u></a> is often one of the more expensive aspects of a funeral with a
            burial. Caskets can range from about $2,000 to up to $20,000 or much more.**</p>

        <p class="pt-4">Though <b>a casket is not required for cremation</b>, many state laws require an âalternative
            container.â</p>

        <p class="pt-4">Also known as cremation containers or cremation caskets, alternative containers are simpler than
            traditional burial caskets. They are usually made of cardboard, wood or fiberboard, without any metal parts.
            Their purpose is to <b>securely hold a loved one before and during <u>the cremation process</u> </b>,
            including on the way from the funeral home to the crematorium.</p>

        <p class="pt-4">State laws require cremation containers to protect the deceased and those responsible for
            transporting them from funeral homes to crematories. Having a loved one in a container makes it easier to
            move the loved one from place to place, including into the cremation chamber.</p>

        <p class="pt-4">The <u>Federal Trade Commission's Funeral Rule</u> requires any funeral home that provides
            cremations to offer families at least one alternative container. Most crematories also require some kind of
            container for a loved one being cremated.</p>

        <p class="pt-4">What if someone chooses to have <b>a viewing or funeral before a cremation?</b></p>

        <p class="pt-4">A casket may be needed for a loved one who will be cremated after a service. Some religions or
            cultures ask that a loved one's body be present at the service. For example, the <u>Catholic Church</u>
            prefers the deceased to be present in a casket for the funeral liturgy. The presence of the loved one at the
            service may also offer a family a sense of comfort, particularly if it's the family's first experience with
            someone choosing cremation. Being present at the service may also have been the personal preference of the
            loved one being honored.</p>

        <p class="pt-4">Additionally, guests who attend a viewing or funeral may expect to see a casket rather than a
            simple container. Even when not required, some <b>families may choose to buy or rent a casket for a
                cremation service.</b></p>

        <p class="pt-4">Rental caskets, also known as ceremonial caskets, combine the look of a traditional casket with
            the functionality of a simple cremation container. A <b>wooden or metal casket exterior houses a cardboard
                alternative container</b> , which can be removed after the service. This choice <b>makes a nice
                presentation and keeps costs down</b>. A rental casket can be as little as half the price of even an
            inexpensive casket.</p>

        <img class="pt-4" src="./images/casket_of_cremation.jpg" alt="Casket of Cremation">


        <h2 class="pt-8 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">A container for cremation</h2>

        <p class="pt-4"><b>Alternative containers can be simple cardboard or plywood/laminate boxes</b>, though many
            families choose to honor their loved ones with a solid wood cremation casket.</p>

        <p class="pt-4">The simplest cardboard options cost about $175, while solid wood cremation caskets may cost up
            to $500.** Containers come in various colors, finishes and materials, from cardboard to wicker to wood.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><b>While budget is one factor, the choice often reflects other considerations</b>. One family
            might choose a solid wood casket with a crepe lining and pillow to provide a sense of comfort when viewing
            their loved one before cremation. Another family may choose an elegant wicker basket to give their loved one
            an earthier farewell. Or a family might select a simple plywood container and then personalize it with art
            and messages.</p>


        <h2 class="pt-8 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">A container for ashes</h2>

        <p class="pt-4">The types of <b>containers for ashes are as varied as the options for what to do with ashes</b>,
            and they range in cost from free to thousands of dollars.**</p>

        <p class="pt-4">Your plans for your loved one's ashes dictate this choice. To give Grandmother a <u>permanent
                resting place</u> in a mausoleum niche, you may want to purchase a pretty urn. To host a scattering
            service for Dad at his favorite fishing hole, you may want to receive his ashes in a scattering urn or a
            simple container. Containers for ashes range from biodegradable tubes to hand-carved wooden boxes to
            decorative ceramic, porcelain or metal urns.</p>

        <img class="pt-4" src="./images/container_of_ashes.jpg" alt="Container of Ashes">

        <p class="pt-4">Here are some of the <b>most common types of containers for ashes.</b></p>

        <h3 class="pt-8 md:text-2xl sm:text-xl">Basic containers</h3>
        <p class="pt-4">Crematories provide funeral homes with ashes encased in rigid plastic or cardboard containers.
            If a family doesn't purchase an urn, that temporary container may be included in the cost of cremation
            services or provided at a nominal charge.**</p>

        <p class="pt-4">Every family who entrusts us with their loved one's cremation can choose a basic container. It
            comes in a care package that includes a handwritten note from a funeral director, an informational booklet
            titled âCaring for Yourself and Your Loved Oneâ and a Remembrance Day packet designed to help the family
            honor their loved one on the one-year anniversary of their passing.</p>

        <h3 class="pt-8 md:text-2xl sm:text-xl">Scattering urns</h3>

        <p class="pt-4">A scattering urn is a temporary container specially designed to help scatter a loved one's ashes
            during a <u>scattering ceremony</u>, often in a meaningful location such as a garden, ocean or forest. The
            design usually incorporates a secure lid, so ashes don't spill during transport, and a spout to make them
            easier to spread evenly and gently.</p>

        <p class="pt-4">Scattering urns can be personalized to reflect the loved one's personality and preferences,
            thereby providing a deeply personal touch to the act of saying a final goodbye. Depending on the material
            and other features, these may cost between $50 and a few hundred dollars.**</p>

        <h3 class="pt-8 md:text-2xl sm:text-xl">Full-size urns</h3>
        <p class="pt-4">Traditional cremation urns are usually crafted from materials such as metal, ceramic, wood or
            glass. A standard cremation urn is roughly comparable to a large vase or a small kitchen appliance, like a
            blender. Both functional and aesthetically pleasing, they often feature intricate designs and engravings.
            Families choose decorative full-size urns when they want to keep a loved one's ashes at home or place them
            in a glass-front mausoleum niche. Though a decorative urn may also be placed in a columbarium or buried in
            the ground, families often choose urns with simpler designs for those types of memorials. Full-size urns
            generally cost in the hundreds of dollars.**</p>

        <h3 class="pt-8 md:text-2xl sm:text-xl">Keepsake urns</h3>
        <p class="pt-4">Like full-size urns, keepsake urns are smaller counterparts that allow multiple family members
            to divide a loved one's ashes. Like full-size urns, keepsake urns are often made of metal, stone or wood and
            come in a wide range of designs, such as a heart, bird, acorn or even a stained-glass lamp. If you wish, a
            keepsake urn may be personalized with engravings to reflect your loved one's unique style and memory.</p>

        <h1 class="pt-8 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">An alternative cremation option</h1>
        <p class="pt-4">Also known as flameless cremation or alkaline hydrolysis, <u>water cremation</u> uses warm
            water, alkaline chemicals, heat and gentle agitation to speed up the natural process that takes place after
            burial. The bone fragments that remain are then carefully processed into ashes that are similar to those
            produced by traditional cremation. Some people feel that water cremation is a gentler process than
            flame-based cremation.</p>

        <p class="pt-4">A water cremation without a service costs between $2,000 and $4,000.**</p>

        <p class="pt-4">No container is used during water cremation, but if there's a service beforehand, a casket or
            container may be needed. Families receive back ashes, and so they may choose an urn of some kind.</p>


        <h1 class="pt-8 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">What's the cheapest way to be cremated?</h1>
        <p class="pt-4">The least expensive <u>cremation option</u> is simple cremation, sometimes known as direct
            cremation. A simple cremation <b>typically costs $700 to $5,000.**</b> It does not include a viewing or
            memorial service.</p>

        <p class="pt-4">People choose this option for themselves or their loved ones to keep costs at a minimum. And
            though it's <b>sometimes called cremation without a ceremony</b>, that doesn't have to be the case. If you
            choose simple cremation, you can still host an informal gathering at home or at a scattering site without
            adding to the cost. What matters is being with friends and family to remember, reflect and heal.</p>

        <img src="./images/cheapest_way_cremation.jpg" alt="Cheapest way of cremation">



        <h1 class="pt-8 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Why do people choose cremation?</h1>
        <p class="pt-4">There are many reasons people choose cremation either for themselves or their loved ones. These
            reasons range from <b>religious considerations to personal preferences</b>.</p>

        <p class="pt-4">Here are some of the more common reasons families choose cremation:</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><b>Flexible memorial options</b>: Cremation allows for flexibility that traditional burial does
            not. When you choose cremation, you have as much time as you need to plan a funeral, memorial or celebration
            of life. You can hold a viewing for nearby family and friends before the cremation and then host a larger
            memorial or <u>scattering service</u> weeks or months later for friends and family who need to make travel
            plans and take off work. That's especially beneficial for those who live in different parts of the country
            or world. Cremation also enables families to focus on the immediacy of their grief and decide on the details
            of a service when they feel ready.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><b>Customization</b>: Cremation allows for nearly endless customization and creativity. Families
            have many special options for memorializing a loved one. Cremated remains can be <u>placed in an ocean
                reef</u> or incorporated into jewelry or art. They can be pressed into vinyl records, made into
            fireworks, placed in a mausoleum niche, scattered from a mountaintop and even <u>launched into space</u>.
            The options are endless and can be as unique as the life being honored.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><b>Lower cost</b>: Cremation can cost less than traditional burial. A simple cremation is the
            least expensive type of cremation and can cost thousands less than a traditional burial with a funeral. A
            cremation with a service can also cost, as you can opt out of a casket or cemetery plot, for instance.</p>

        <p class="pt-4"><b>No religious affiliation</b>: More Americans than ever claim to have no affiliation with a
            particular religion. Since many funeral and burial traditions are rooted in religious beliefs, many people
            are choosing cremation as a way to create a new tradition.</p>



        <h1 class="pt-8 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">Our complimentary cremation offerings</h1>

        <h1 class="pt-8 md:text-4xl sm:text-xl">More and more families are choosing cremation</h1>
        <p class="pt-4"><u>The Cremation Association of North America</u> projects that by 2028, 67% of Americans will
            choose cremation, compared to 33% burial. These numbers are up from a little more than a decade ago, when
            approximately 45% chose cremation. Numbers are even higher in Canada, where the cremation rate was 75% in
            2023. U.S. cremation rates <u>vary by region</u>, from around 33% in Mississippi to more than 83% in Nevada.
